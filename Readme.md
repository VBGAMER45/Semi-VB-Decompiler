### Recent Updates:

Added a helper application called Api Add which allows you to add API's to the Semi VB Decompiler API Database.

Updated Native procedure decompile dissembles faster and added some native dissemble options to the options screen. Also updated decompile from offset, now verifies the file has a VB5! signature. For .Net applications added the view console under the Tools menu. Added data directories to the PE Optional Header list.

Two minor little fixes on project generation. Fixed a bug with directory listbox and bug in VBP generation.

Changed how the P-Code property database worked the VTable information is now directly pulled form the typelib of VB6.OLB, this means that Semi VB Decompiler now has complete support for all properties of the standard VB toolbox controls.

Updates over the last month, added menu for easy access to the other tools,  added over 100 more P-Code properties to the database. Fixed some handling of certain VB files.

Added another tool to Semi VB Decompiler a VB Obfuscator for Visual Basic 5/6. What does an Obfuscator do? Well it makes the decompiled code harder to read and understand, making a little tougher.   My version obfuscates the object names, and control names for Visual Basic 5/6 programs.

Version 0.07 released.   Now using a property sheet control to display and edit control/form properties.  Under the treeview, the controls now have there own icons to recognize the control type.  More properties for the controls added.  Improved the speed on various functions. Under the tools menu there is now a link to the FileReport.txt. Working on a system to handle external controls.
