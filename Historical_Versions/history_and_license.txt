     A Semi VB Decomiler. Decompiles the interface using COM. COM is not always correct in the datatypes it returns for a certain property. I started this project a week ago after seeing there were no good open source vb interface decompilers and the other examples on this site are not very good. Another reason is there are some companies that charge for just decompiling the interface which I do not think is very fair. This is not complete but use it as a guide to making your own interface decompiler and maybe make something more. Hope you can learn something from this.

Release 0.03 Added Ocx Support Added P-Code procedure decompile to P-Code tokens. Added Image Extraction Added Better Handling of Control properties. Added Form Patch Editor Added Syntax Coloring. Better support of User Controls/And MDI Forms. Api's Recovered Procedure Names recovered for Forms and classes. Resizing of the windows added. Numerous Bug fixes and other things added. Begun work on a basic antidecompiler. Features Advanced decompiling using COM via VB6.OLB Using COM allows me not to have to hard code every single property The only properties that need to be hardcoded is the size, font, and dataformat opcodes. One day I hope to use msvbvm60.dll instead of vb6.olb so nothing will have to be hardcoded. This is the best Open Source VB Decompiler you can find. Show your support and leave comments and vote.

VB6- Semi VB Decompiler

    Semi VB Decompiler
    This is the only open source example that allows you to look inside the file format of vb 6.0 native/pcode exe or ocx.
    It uses COM to find out the opcodes for the grahpical components of the exe, which means less things need to be hardcoded.
    Learn the important visual basic strutures in a vb exe , understand why COM is an important part of the visual basic system, and see what is going on behind the scenes in your program. Enjoy.

    Release 0.03
    Added Ocx Support

Re: VB6- Semi VB Decompiler

    Wow, first time somone responded in a long time. Well Semi VB Decompiler is no longer open source and the current version is 0.06. Been busy rewriting and adding new features all the time.
    http://www.visualbasiczone.com/produ...mivbdecompiler

    Main things that I want to work on now is .Net support, right now my goal is a basic IL Dissassembler. Right now it just processes some of metadata information and displays the streams and shows the clr header. The other thing I want to add is full support for VB 2/3 decompiling. Half way to my goal with my VB 1/2/3 binary form to text converter is almost complete, you can make these things a lot faster after the first time around.

    Some of the internal structures that I used can be found at vb-decompiler.com a nice place to get you started on a P-Code decompiler. That's where I started and within a couple months I now know a lot of information and how VB really works.

    Native decompiling I actually think it can be done, but I would have to write my own disassembly engine then I can at least process and translate certain vb api calls. Very time consuming.

*Does not recover parameters of api calls.
**Recovers some basic information nothing really useful.
Recent Updates:

Added a helper application called Api Add which allows you to add API's to the Semi VB Decompiler API Database.

Updated Native procedure decompile dissembles faster and added some native dissemble options to the options screen. Also updated decompile from offset, now verifies the file has a VB5! signature. For .Net applications added the view console under the Tools menu. Added data directories to the PE Optional Header list.

Two minor little fixes on project generation. Fixed a bug with directory listbox and bug in VBP generation.

Changed how the P-Code property database worked the VTable information is now directly pulled form the typelib of VB6.OLB, this means that Semi VB Decompiler now has complete support for all properties of the standard VB toolbox controls.

Updates over the last month, added menu for easy access to the other tools,  added over 100 more P-Code properties to the database. Fixed some handling of certain VB files.

Added another tool to Semi VB Decompiler a VB Obfuscator for Visual Basic 5/6. What does an Obfuscator do? Well it makes the decompiled code harder to read and understand, making a little tougher.   My version obfuscates the object names, and control names for Visual Basic 5/6 programs.

Version 0.07 released.   Now using a property sheet control to display and edit control/form properties.  Under the treeview, the controls now have there own icons to recognize the control type.  More properties for the controls added.  Improved the speed on various functions. Under the tools menu there is now a link to the FileReport.txt. Working on a system to handle external controls.

Thumbs up Semi VB Decompiler - Source Code + More

    Been about five years since I have done any VB decompiler work so releasing what I have done so far. Has been a great learning experience for me and should help others as well!


    Learn about internal VB structure, exe file formats. Supports VB 4,5,6
    vb 2,3 can be supported with the addons.
    .Net CLR information, processing streams.
    And more!


    All I ask if you use is include me in the credits.
